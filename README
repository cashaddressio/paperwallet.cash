*** paperwallet.cash ***

This project is a fork of bitcoinpaperwallet.com, which originated from bitaddress.org, the original trustworthy
JavaScript powered offline bitcoin address generator. 

This generator includes the same pseudorandom key generation as bitaddress.org, as
well as support for creating wallets using "vanity keys", passphrases ("brain wallets")
or even rolling dice or shuffling cards.

Use the "Verify or Decrypt" tab to decrypt a BIP38 password-encrypted wallet, check the
integrity of any private key, or even duplicate an exising wallet by scanning its
QR code.

*** HOW TO USE THIS GENERATOR ***

1) Extract the ZIP file
2) Open up the 'generate-wallet.html' file with your web browser. 
3) If you like you can select a different language or holiday theme
4) Follow the steps for calibrating your printer and then printing
   the front and back of each wallet. Use landscape mode when printing!
   
Rendering and printing seems to work best using: 

   OS X:     Safari or Chrome or Firefox
   Windows:  Firefox or Chrome
   Linux:    Firefox

When using Chrome on Windows, use the Chrome print dialog. Switching to the
Windows system print dialog will produce corrupted/illegible keys.

QR scanning works best using Firefox since Chrome will not access the camera controls
when opening a locally saved HTML file.
